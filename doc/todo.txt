When getting psen via nuget:
it will be installed to
/packages/psen.1.0.1/tools/build.ps1
/packages/psen.1.0.1/tools/psake_ext.ps1
/packages/psen.1.0.1/tools/psen.ps1
the scripts will afterwards be copied to the location:
build.ps1
scripts/psake_ext.ps1
scripts/psen.ps1

the user may customize the scripts by doing the following:


install by running this from package manager console:

or run this from command line from root folder of project:
- nuget install psen -o packages
- copy the script build.ps1 to root folder of project
